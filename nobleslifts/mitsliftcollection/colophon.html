		<h3>Behind the scenes</h3>
		<p align="center" style="font-size: 16px;font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">
			Mitsubishi Lift Collection is proud to have chosen GitHub Pages as its platform of choice for hosting this site.
		</p>
		<p>
			This site is written in pure HTML and CSS using Visual Studio Code.
			<br>
			If this site appears a bit too plain- you are not wrong. It's design is deliberately kept simple to allow for compatibility with older browsers as well as slower internet connections - less bloat means less loading time after all; plus that also allows for easier maintenance as there are less moving parts.
			<br><br>
			For all the privacy nerds out there; rejoice - this site does not track you in any form, and does not use any sort of browser cookies.
		</p>

		<h3>Browser compatibility</h3>
		<p>
			This site will work on any browser that supports basic HTML and CSS. (yes, that includes Internet Explorer!)
			<br>
			A text-mode browser like <a href="https://lynx.invisible-island.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lynx</a>, will also work well, thanks to the simplicity of this site 
			(though you will not be able to see any images).

		<h3>Quality in Motion and the nickel test</h3>
		<p>
			"Quality in Motion" is Mitsubishi Electric's slogan for its lift and escalator offerings.
			<br>
			It represents Mitsubishi's commitment to producing lifts and escalators of high quality, ensuring a high level of comfort, efficiency, ecology as well as safety.
			<br>
			Using the "nickel test"; as shown in the below video, Quality in Motion can be seen in how smooth Mitsubishi lifts run.
