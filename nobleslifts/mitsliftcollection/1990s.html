		<h4>Identifying a 1990s SP-VF from a 1980s SP-VF</h4>
		<p>
			Even though an SP-VF made in the 1990s appears at first glance no different from one made in the 1980s, one can identify (most) 1990s SP-VF from a 1980s Mitsubishi from looking at certain details on the capacity plaque. See the below infographic for details.

		<h4>GPS and GPM</h4>
		<p>
			In the early 1990s, Mitsubishi introduced the GPS and GPM models, for low/mid-rise and high-rise buildings, respectively.
			<br>
			The GPS and GPM was a major redesign from the SP-VF.
			<br><br>
			Apart from changes to the mechanics and the controller, for the first time, dot matrix LED displays were introduced, and came as standard.
			Aside from that; the car and landing panels have been totally revamped from previous variants.
			The buttons were now bigger and more rectangular; plus its typeface was changed from Univers to Helvetica.
			<br><br>
			Another major change is the introduction of voice announcements as an optional feature; available with the following options:
			<ul>
				<li><b>AAN-B:</b> Basic announcements - only special messages </li>
				<li><b>AAN-G:</b> Voice guidance system - guidance as well as special messages</li>
			</ul>
			<i>(See <a href="aan.html">AAN voiceovers</a> for more information.)</i>
			<br><br>
			As well as that, false call cancelling was introduced as an optional feature; 
			<br>
			whereby a car call could be canceled by double-tapping the respective floor button.
			<br><br>
			The GPS (and GPM) still had the electronic bell chimes as an optional feature; something carried forward from the SP-VF.
			<br> 
			As a base option, the classic mechanical bell was often still used by many GPS (and GPM) lifts.
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>"Transitional phase" fixtures</b>
			<br>
			Some Mitsubishi GPS lifts continued to use the rare "Series 1" stainless-steel panel style for the car station.
			<br>
			These fixtures still used the SP-VF style of buttons, as well as the Univers typeface is still used for the buttons as well as the capacity text.
			<br><br>
			However, the indicator is a LED dot-matrix display as opposed to a segmented display. As well as that, the hall fixtures are same as those used on the GPS models.
			<br><br>
			Hence, this guide refers to these fixtures as well as the lifts using them, unofficially, as the "Transitional phase",
			<br>
			as they combine both old and new elements from the SP-VF and GPS eras, respectively.

		<h4>GPS-III and GPM-III</h4>
		<p>
			The GPS-III and GPM-III (for low/mid rise and high-rise, respectively.), introduced in the late 1990s; was an improvement over the original GPS and its variants. 
			<br><br>
			With the GPS- and GPM-III series; electronic chimes were now a standard issue; deprecating the old mechanical bell chimes.
			<br>
			The fixtures too got some changes; the buttons now are square as opposed to rectangular on the original GPS; coupled with an increase in the font size.
			<br>
			As well as that; the car station and hall station too got design changes from the original GPS.
			For high-rise lifts; a smaller variant of the buttons had been introduced as well.
			<br><br>
			Like its predecessor, the car station had been available in stainless steel as well as dark grey plastic variants.
