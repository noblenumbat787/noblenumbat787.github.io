		<h3>Universal Design</h3>
		<p>
			Introduced in 2001, Universal Design saw a redesign of the buttons - they were now barrel-shaped; plus a change in typeface to Gill Sans from Helvetica. Also, the car position indicators saw a redesign as well.
			<br><br>
			These fixtures were used on Elenessa as well as NexWay lifts during the 2000s.
			The smaller buttons for high-rise installations also saw some changes; including the shift to Gill Sans as its typeface, as well as the change in shape of the door control and alarm buttons to match Universal Design.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Elenessa</h4>
		<p>
			Elenessa is the model of MRL (machine-room-less) lifts made by Mitsubishi during the 2000s.

		<h3 id="elemotion-1970s">ELEMOTION</h3>
		<p>
			ELEMOTION is Mitsubishi's solution for lift modernisations, having been introduced in 2001, replacing prior modernisation solutions such as the GPS-IIIMZ. 
			<br>
			These lifts are generally modernisations of older Mitsubishi lifts only; as they cannot be used for modernisations of non-Mitsubishi lifts (in which case a full replacement is required).
			<br>
			Originally, ELEMOTION was meant for low or mid-rise buildings only; for high-rise modernisation the NexWay Modernization was offered instead.
			<br><br>
			ELEMOTION lifts modernised during this era generally came with Universal Design fixtures; and generally used an altered version of the regular two-tone Mitsubishi chime as well.
