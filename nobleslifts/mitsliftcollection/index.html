		<h1>Konnichiwa! Welcome!</h1>
		This site is an online repository for Mitsubishi lifts of all speeds, shapes and sizes.
		<br><br>
		<i><b>
			First off, yes, Mitsubishi (yes, that Mitsubishi - the one who also makes cars^), makes lifts and escalators too.
			<br><br>
			Read on to know more about Mitsubishi's presence in the lift industry:
		</b></i>
		<p align="center" style="font-family: Ubuntu; color:ff9118; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;"><i>"the Americans invented the lift; the Japanese perfected it."</i></p>
		<p>
			Mitsubishi Electric makes lifts and escalators under the subsidiary Mitsubishi Electric Building Solutions Corporation. 
			<br>
			Although formed in 1954, Mitsubishi was involved in the lift and escalator business since 1931, having initally had an technical agreement with Westinghouse of USA, till around the 1970s.
			<br><br>
			Mitsubishi's lifts are well-known around the world for their innovation, as well as their excellent craftsmanship and durability, with many units surviving decades.
			<br>
			Mitsubishi, though not being the first in the lift and escalator business, has been credited for many innovations in the domain.
			<br>
			For instance; their lifts have broken records thrice for being the fastest in the world:
		</p>	
		<ul>
			<li>Sunshine 60 (60 floors; Japan, 1978) - 600 m/min (10 m/s) both ways.</li>
			<li>Yokohama Landmark Tower (73 floors; Japan, 1993) - 750 m/min (12.5 m/s) both ways.</li>
			<li>Shanghai Tower (128 floors; China, 2015) - 1080-1230 m/min (18-20.5 m/s) up; 600 m/min (10 m/s) down.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			For context, the lifts in the tallest building in the world - the Burj Khalifa in the UAE (163 floors, 830 m; opened in 2010) are only 10 m/s (both ways) Otis lifts up to the observation deck on floor 124. 
			<br>
			Mitsubishi is only one of the few lift companies who have been able to make lifts capable of going beyond 10 m/s.
