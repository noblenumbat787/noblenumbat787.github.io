		<h3>Elepet</h3>
		<p>
			Mitsubishi continued manufacturing their Elepet series of lifts, dating from the 60s and 70s.
		</p>
		<h4>early 1980s</h4>
		<p>
			These lifts used black rounded buttons and analogue indicators.
			<br>
			For the first time, Univers typeface was used on the indicators as well as buttons.
			<br>

		<h4>mid 1980s</h4>
		<p>
			In the 1980s, Mitsubishi used brown square buttons as well as started to introduce digital indicators in lieu of their older analogue ones.
			<br>
			However, their base models lacked any car position indicator of any kind; and the buttons instead doubled up as analogue floor indicators.

		<h3>SP- and MP-VF</h3>
		<h4>late 1980s</h4>
		<p>
			Around the mid-to late 1980s, Mitsubishi started production of the SP-VF and MP-VF (low and mid-high rise, respectively) as replacements for the Elepet. 
			<br>
			These lifts brought digital displays as standard for the car position indicator; though was offered as an option for the hall position indicator.
			<br><br>
			Both SP- and MP-VF lifts still used brown buttons like those in the Elepet; though with slight tweaks, including a (slightly) larger font.
